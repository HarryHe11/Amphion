## About ‚≠êÔ∏è
The **Emilia** is a comprehensive, multilingual dataset with the following features:
- containing over *101k* hours of speech data;
- covering six different languages: *English (En), Chinese (Zh), German (De), French (Fr), Japanese (Ja), and Korean (Ko)*;
- containing diverse speech data with *various speaking styles*;
  
Detailed description for the dataset could be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05361).

üõ†Ô∏è **Emilia-Pipe** is the first open-source preprocessing pipeline designed to transform raw, in-the-wild speech data into high-quality training data with annotations for speech generation. This pipeline can process one hour of raw audio into model-ready data in just a few minutes, requiring only the raw speech data. 

## Dataset Usage üé§
The Emilia dataset is now publicly available at [OpenDataLab](https://opendatalab.com/Amphion/Emilia)!

To download the Emilia dataset, please follow these steps:

1. Fill out the [Application Form](https://speechteam.feishu.cn/share/base/form/shrcn7z8VODrVkOelbx0YUeJDOh) to receive the PASSWORD.
2. Visit the [OpenXLab dataset](https://openxlab.org.cn/datasets/Amphion/Emilia/tree/main/raw) and click the "Apply Download" button.
3. Enter the PASSWORD you received in step 1 into the "Detailed Purpose Description" input box and submit your download request. Applications will only be approved if the correct PASSWORD is provided. Once approved, you can enjoy using the dataset!


The Emilia dataset will be structured as follows:

- **Speech Data**: High-quality audio recordings in .mp3 format.
- **Transcriptions**: Corresponding text transcriptions for each audio file.

*Please note that Emilia does not own the copyright to the audio files; the copyright remains with the original owners of the videos or audio. Users are permitted to use this dataset only for non-commercial purposes under the CC BY-NC-4.0 license.*

 
## Emilia-Pipe Overview üëÄ
If you wish to re-build Emilia, you may download the raw audio files from the [provided URL list](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia) and use our open-source [Emilia-Pipe](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion/tree/main/preprocessors/Emilia) preprocessing pipeline to preprocess the raw data. Additionally, users can easily use Emilia-Pipe to preprocess their own raw speech data for custom needs. By open-sourcing the Emilia-Pipe code, we aim to enable the speech community to collaborate on large-scale speech generation research.

The Emilia-Pipe includes the following major steps:

0. StandardizationÔºöAudio normalization
1. Source Separation: Long audio -> Long audio without BGM
2. Speaker Diarization: Get medium-length single-speaker speech data
3. Fine-grained Segmentation by VAD: Get 3-30s single-speaker speech segments
4. ASR: Get transcriptions of the speech segments
5. Filtering: Obtain the final processed dataset

## Setup Steps üë®‚Äçüíª

### 0. Prepare Environment

1. Install Python and CUDA.
2. Run the following commands to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    conda create -y -n AudioPipeline python=3.9 
    conda activate AudioPipeline

    bash env.sh
    ```

3. Download the model files from the third-party repositories.
    - Manually download the checkpoints of UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3 ([UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_3.onnx](https://github.com/TRvlvr/model_repo/releases/download/all_public_uvr_models/UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx)) and DNSMOS P.835 ([sig_bak_ovr.onnx](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge/blob/master/DNSMOS/DNSMOS/sig_bak_ovr.onnx)), then save their path for the next step configuration (i.e. #2  and #3 TODO).
    - Creat the access token to pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 following [the guide](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1#requirements), then save it for the next step configuration (i.e. #4 TODO).
    - Make sure you have stable connection to GitHub and HuggingFace. The checkpoints of Silero and Whisperx-medium will be downloaded automatically on the pipeline's first run. 


### 1. Modify Config File

Change the config.json file according to the following TODOs.

```json
{
    "language": {
        "multilingual": true,
        "supported": [
            "zh",
            "en",
            "fr",
            "ja",
            "ko",
            "de"
        ]
    },
    "entrypoint": {
        // TODO: Fill in the input_folder_path. 
        "input_folder_path": "examples", // #1: Data input folder for processing
        "SAMPLE_RATE": 24000
    },
    "separate": {
        "step1": {
            // TODO: Fill in the source separation model's path. 
            "model_path": "/path/to/model/separate_model/UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx", // #2: Model path
            "denoise": true,
            "margin": 44100,
            "chunks": 15,
            "n_fft": 6144,
            "dim_t": 8,
            "dim_f": 3072
        }
    },
    "mos_model": {
        // TODO: Fill in the DNSMOS prediction model's path. 
        "primary_model_path": "/path/to/model/mos_model/DNSMOS/sig_bak_ovr.onnx" // #3: Model path
    },
     // TODO: Fill in your huggingface access token for pynannote. 
    "huggingface_token": "<HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN>" // #4: Huggingface access token for pyannote
}
```

### 2. Run Script

1. Change the `input_folder_path` in `config.json` to the folder path where the downloaded audio files are stored (i.e. #1 TODO).
2. Run the following command to process the audio files:

```bash
conda activate AudioPipeline
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  # Setting the GPU to run the pipeline, separate by comma

python main.py
```

3. Processed audio will be saved into `input_folder_path`_processed folder.


### 3. Check the Results

The processed audio (default 24k sample rate) files will be saved into `input_folder_path`_processed folder. The results for a single audio will be saved in a same folder with its original name and include the following information:

1. **MP3 file**: `<original_name>_<idx>.mp3` where `idx` is corresponding to the index in the JSON-encoded array.
2. **JSON file**: `<original_name>.json`

```json
[
    {
        "text": "So, don't worry about that. But, like for instance, like yesterday was very hard for me to say, you know what, I should go to bed.", // Transcription
        "start": 67.18, // Start timestamp, in second unit
        "end": 74.41, // End timestamp, in second unit
        "language": "en", // Language
        "dnsmos": 3.44 // DNSMOS P.835 score
    }
]
```
